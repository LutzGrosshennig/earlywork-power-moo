# earlywork-power-moo
An early (ca. 1996) clone of Kai's Power Goo technology to "liquify" pictures of people for fun.

As a student I was employed in a small company by the name "Software Dynamics GmbH". The boss showed us Kai's Power Goo and asked "Why cant we do something like this?" And I replied: "I can." and so the whole thing started.

When you look at the originial it is basicly a 2d displacement mapping going on. So its not a big deal, however doing this at interactive framerates on something like an Pentium 1 at 133Mhz was a big deal back then. I mean we are basicaly talking about a baseline of Windows95, 133Mhz with 32 Megs of EDO RAM paired with a 8-16MB PCI (32bit) 2d/3d card (no those were not GPU's strictly speeking.)

However this is the project I used to fine tune what I called the "moo engine". It formed the underlying engine used in an commercial product later on. The final commerical product was called "Liquid Pics" by Software Dynamics GmbH and was usually bundled with some Hardware (i.e. Toschibas CD/DVD drives came with a CD called Manuals and More that contained a copy of Liquid Pics).

However since "liquifing" pictures is still fun I will release this piece of research to the public.
